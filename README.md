openresty-example
=================

This is a slightly modified clone of davidad's [example](https://github.com/davidad/openresty-heroku-example) repo showing the use of his [openresty build pack](https://github.com/davidad/heroku-buildpack-openresty).  I cloned it as part of his workshop, then uploaded it for a friend who wanted to see how I had gotten access to an external html file (open-resty is not your typical web framework :) ).  

You should really look at the original if you're interested in this kind of thing.
